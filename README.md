## Background

This project tested my skills in object-oriented JavaScript. I was given some starter code which included a set of images as well as the game loop engine which created the game's canvas out of those images. From thereon, I worked on building various classes within the `app.js` file and creating custom elements using HTML and CSS.

## Instructions

To play, click [here](https://neocyte.github.io/Frogger-Game/).

The goal of the game is for your player to reach the water and score as many points as possible. Beware of the bugs!

Use the arrows keys to move up, down, left, and right.

## Contributing

This repository is based off of the starter code provided to _all_ Udacity students. Therefore, I most likely will not accept pull requests.
